**Project and Funding:** Forecast model from the Predicting the Evolution of the Amazon Catchment to Forecast the Level Of Water (PEACFLOW) project. PEACFLOW project is funded by Newton Fund through the Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) Brazil project at UK Met Office.

**Modules:** This repository contains two modules.
- *Using_Observations:* https://github.com/achevuturi/PEACFLOW_Manaus-flood-forecasting/tree/master/Using_Observations
- *Using_Seasonal-Forecasts:* https://github.com/achevuturi/PEACFLOW_Manaus-flood-forecasting/tree/master/Using_Seasonal-Forecasts

**Description:** This repository contains models for forecasting annual maximum water level for Negro River at Manaus, using observations and seasonal forecasts data using the two modules. Each module within this repository ("*Using_Observations*" or "*Using_Seasonal-Forecasts*") has models that forecast annual maximum water level for Negro River at Manaus at different lead-time. For more details about the models and their execution please read the README.md files contained within each module folders. 

**Citation:** Depending on the module used, the users who apply the software resulting in presentations/publications, are kindly asked to cite one/both of the publication below:
