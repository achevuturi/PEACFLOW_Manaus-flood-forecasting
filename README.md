# Manaus_flood_forecasting

Diagnostics from the CSSP Brazil PEACFLOW project on forecasting annual flood levels at Manaus

This repository has a shell script which downloads the requred CHIRPS rainfall estimate and executes the flood forecasting model to give the flood forecast for the year requested.

The model works by running the forecast_model.sh script and giving the year for which the forecast is required (2005 onwards) when prompted by the script:

./forecast_model.sh
